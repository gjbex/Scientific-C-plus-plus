# Functional
Examples of functional programming style in C++.

## What is it?
1. `aggregate.cpp`: implements a vector reduction with a reductor function
    as an argument, and lambda functions are provided as arguments. (Note
    that C++ STL has this algorithm implmented in a more general way.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.
1. `StreamingData`: comparison between functional and object-oriented approach
   to computing streaming statistics.
1. `PersistentBinaryTrees`: purely functional implementation of a doubly-linked list.
1. `FibonacciGenerator`: illustration of how to define and use a generator in C++23.
