C++ is widely used in many contexts.
This training focusses on using C++ for scientific programming and on
the way Bjarne Stroustrup advocates modern C++ in his book "A tour of
C++".  Some C++17 features and third party libraries will also be
discussed.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * read and understand well-written C++ code;
  * write intermediate-level C++ programs;
  * have a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the more
    sophisticated aspects of C++ by practicing.
  * know about best practices and pitfalls for C++ programmers;
  * have a working knowledge of the C++ Standard Template Library
    (STL);
  * know how to use third-party libraries such as Armadillo or
    Eigen for linear algebra.

## Training materials

Slides are available in the
 [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gjbex/Scientific-C-plus-plus/),
as well as example code and hands-on material.


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use C++ as a programming
language.


## Prerequisites

You will need experience programming in another programming language,
This is not a training that starts from scratch.

If you plan to do C++ programming in a Linux or HPC environment you should
be familiar with these as well.
