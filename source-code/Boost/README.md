# Boost
Some illustrations of using the Boost C++ library, mainly in the
context of mathematics (vector and matrix operations, and solving
ordinary differential equations).

## What is it?
1. `Bimap`: using the Boost bimap data structure, a bi-directional map.
1. `Brent`: using the Boost `math` library to find the minimum of a
    function using Brent's method.
1. `Coroutines`: using the Boost `coroutines2` library to emulate Python's
generator functions.
1. `Logging`: using the Boost logging facilities.
1. `Odeint`: using the Boost `odeint` library to solve a set of ordinary
    differential equations.
1. `Process`: using the Boost `process` library to start and communicate
    with subprocesses.
1. `ProgramOptions`: using the Boost `program_options` library to deal with
    command line arguments.
1. `Units`: using the Boost `units` library to catch errors.
1. `Vector`: illustration of vectors and vector operations using Boost.
