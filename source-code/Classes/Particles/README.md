Simple example of inheritance in C++.


## What is it?

1. `static_particle.h`: declaration of particle base class.
1. `static_particle.cpp`: particle base class implementation.
1. `particle.h`: declaration of derived class for particles with velocity.
1. `particle.cpp`: implementation of derived class.
1. `main.cpp`: main program to illustrate the use of dervied class.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
