# Basics
Code used to illustrate the basic concepts of C++.

## What is it?
1. `hello.cpp`: canonical hello world in C++.
1. `talk.cpp`: illustrates I/O streams.
1. `col_dist.cpp`: another illustration of I/O streams.
1. `data.txt`: data file to be used with `talk.exe`.
1. `data_parser.cpp`: illustration use case for `continue` statement.
1. `gcd.cpp`: factorial function implemention, illustrating `while`.
1. `fac.cpp`: factorial function implemention, illustrating `for`.
1. `local_namespace_use.cpp`: example of using a namespace in the context
    of a function only.
1. `scope.cpp`: illustration of block scope.
1. `swap.cpp`: illustration of call by reference.
1. `arrays.cpp`: illustration of arrays in C++.
1. `argument_passing.cpp`: illustrates that data is not copied when
    passing `vector` from and to functions.
1. `arrays_vs_pointers.cpp`: code illustrating that an array is only
   the address of the first element is passed to a function in a function
   call with an array as argument. **Note:** the compiler will generate
   a warning, but that is intentional.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
