# Source code

This is some sample code written in C++, with no or little bearing on
non-standard libraries.  It is mainly intended to illustrate some
programming concepts and idiosyncracies particular to C++.

## What is it?
1. `Basics`: illustration of basic C++ features for the presentation.
1. `UserDefinedTypes`: illustrations of user diefined types in C++ for
    the presentation.
1. `Modularity`: illustrations of modularity in C++ for the
    presentation.
1. `Classes`: illustration of classes in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Templates`: illustration of templates in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Regexes`: illustrations of strings and regular expressions in C++
    for the presentation.
1. `IoStreams`: illustration of templates in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Functional`: some illustrations of a functional programming style
    in C++,  using higher order functions.
1. `Containers`: illustration of containers in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Algorithms`: illustration of classes in C++ for the presentation.
1. `Numerics`: illustration of doing numerical computations in C++, based
    on Bjarne Stroustrup's "A tour of C++", chapter 12.
1. `Random`: some illustrations of using the pseudorandom generator in
    standard C++.
1. `STL`: some illustrations of using the STL library.

    library.
1. `Eigen`: some illustrations of using the Eigen linear algebra library.
1. `Xtensor`: some illustrations of using the Xtensor multi-dimensional array
    library that resembles numpy.
1. `Boost`: some illustrations of using the Boost C++ library,
    mostly in the context of numerical programming.
1. `UsingCLibraries`: illustration of how to use a C library from C++ code.
1. `GrammarFeatures`: illustrations of recent C++ grammar features added in
    recent C++ standarsd
    specification.
1. `Ranges`: ranges are an interesting concept for working more
    conveniently with STL containers and composing algorithms.
