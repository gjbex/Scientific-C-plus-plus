# Counter

This class implements a counter for integers in a given range. The counter can
be incremented for a given value, and the count for a given value can be
retrieved.

An iterator over values-count pairs is also provided, illustrating how to
create a custom iterator for a data structure.


## What is it?

1. `counter.h`: header file defines the `Counter` class.
1. `main_counter.cpp`: application that illustrates use of the `Counter` class.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
