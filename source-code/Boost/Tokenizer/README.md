# Tokenizer

The Boost tokenizer is a C++ library that provides a simple and efficient way
to tokenize strings. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing
you to customize the tokenization process to suit your needs.V


## What is it?

1. `tabular_sum.cpp`: C++ application that reads tabular data from standard
   input and computes the sum of each column. It uses the Boost tokenizer to parse
   the input data.  The first line of the data is expected to contain the column names.
   A separator can be specified to split the columns. The default separator is a comma (`,`).
1. `data_comma.txt`: Sample input data file with comma-separated values.
1. `data_semicolon.txt`: Sample input data file with semicolon-separated values.
1. `CMakefile`: CMake file to build the applications.
