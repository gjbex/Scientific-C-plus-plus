# Fibonacci generator

C++23 introduces a new feature called `generator` which is a type of coroutine
that can be used to generate a sequence of values lazily. This is a simple
example of a generator that generates the Fibonacci sequence.

**Note**: This code requires a C++23 compiler that supports the `generator` feature, e.g., g++ 14.x or later.


## What is it?

1. `fib.cpp`: C++ application that illustrates the definition and use of a generator.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the application.
